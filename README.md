I am a Frontend Developer with 1+ years of experience in building modern and responsive web applications. Currently, I work at Veramed Health Solutions, where I contribute to healthcare and medical platforms. I specialize in React.js, Next.js, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, and have strong experience in creating reusable, scalable, and maintainable UI components. I have worked on modern dashboards, CRM systems, and SaaS-based applications with a focus on clean UI and usability. I am experienced in integrating REST APIs using Axios and Fetch API and managing application state with Redux, Redux Toolkit, and React Query. I focus on performance optimization through code splitting and efficient rendering while ensuring smooth user interactions. I am comfortable working in Agile environments and collaborating closely with backend and design teams. I am passionate about writing clean code, building modern user interfaces, and developing real-world products.
